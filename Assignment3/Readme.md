## Assignment 3:
Train 1 denoising and 1 contractive autoencoder on the MNIST dataset. It is up to you to decide how many layers and neurons in each layer you want in the deep autoencoder. Show an accuracy comparison between the different autoencoders.
Then, experiment with what happens if you feed the autoencoders with a random noise image and then you apply the iterative gradient ascent process described in the lecture to see if the reconstruction converges to the data manifold. Confront the reconstructions created by the 2 different models and comment on the results.
